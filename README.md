# pv_parameters

**Research Objective**

The current Jupyter Notebook extract the basic PV parameters from the J-V curve of µSMU device: Voc, Jsc, FF, Rs, Rp.

Note: The conversión efficiency is not calculated at this moment. If the insidence irradiance its know you can calculate using the following equation. 

$$\eta = \frac{V_{oc}J_{sc}FF}{1000 \:\text{W}/m^2}$$
